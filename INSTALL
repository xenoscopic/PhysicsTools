Installation Instructions
=========================

Dependencies
------------
The tools have the following dependencies:
1. CMake 2.6.4 or later
2. Boost
3. ROOT

Compiling
---------
To compile, you must first generate the CMake build files.  From the source directory, do:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

You can now run the tools directly from the build directory, e.g.

$ ./skimslim --help
